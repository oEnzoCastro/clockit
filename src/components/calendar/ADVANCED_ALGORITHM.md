# Advanced Positioning Algorithm - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Algorithm Source

This positioning algorithm is based on the **Calendar.tsx** component's advanced overlap detection system. It provides **perfect positioning** for events with complex overlapping scenarios.

---

## 🔑 Key Improvements Over Previous Version

### Previous Algorithm (Simple Column Assignment):
```
1. Sort events by start time
2. Assign each event to first available column
3. Calculate max columns per event based on overlaps
```

**Limitations:**
- Could create unnecessary gaps
- Didn't handle complex overlap patterns optimally
- Column reuse wasn't always efficient

### New Algorithm (Overlap Groups):
```
1. Sort events by start time, then end time
2. Group events that overlap into clusters
3. Assign columns WITHIN each group independently
4. Each group calculates its own optimal layout
```

**Advantages:**
✅ Perfect column packing - no wasted space
✅ Handles complex overlapping scenarios flawlessly
✅ Independent optimization per overlap group
✅ Better visual separation between event clusters

---

## 📊 Algorithm Flow Breakdown

### **Phase 1: Sorting & Preparation**

```typescript
// Sort events by start time, then by end time
sortedEvents.sort((a, b) => {
  if (startA !== startB) return startA - startB;
  return endA - endB; // Shorter events first
});
```

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures consistent processing order
- Shorter events get priority (better visual flow)
- Predictable behavior for identical start times

---

### **Phase 2: Overlap Group Detection**

```typescript
const overlapGroups: number[][] = [];

for each event:
  check if it overlaps with any existing group:
    if YES → add to that group
    if NO → create new group with this event
```

**Example:**
```
Events:
A: 08:00-10:00
B: 08:30-09:30
C: 10:00-11:00
D: 10:30-11:30

Groups:
Group 1: [A, B]      // A and B overlap
Group 2: [C, D]      // C and D overlap, but don't overlap with Group 1
```

**Key Insight:**
- Events in different groups can reuse the same column positions
- Each group is independent, allowing for optimal space usage

---

### **Phase 3: Column Assignment Within Groups**

For each overlap group:

```typescript
1. Sort group events by start time
2. For each event in the group:
   a. Try column 0, then 1, then 2, etc.
   b. Check if column is free during event's time period
   c. Assign to first available column
   d. Mark column as occupied
```

**Example - Group with 3 overlapping events:**

```
Event A: 08:00-10:00
Event B: 08:30-09:30
Event C: 09:00-11:00

Step 1: Process A
  - Column 0 is free → Assign A to Column 0

Step 2: Process B
  - Column 0 occupied by A (08:00-10:00) → conflicts
  - Column 1 is free → Assign B to Column 1

Step 3: Process C
  - Column 0 occupied by A (08:00-10:00) → conflicts (C: 09:00-11:00)
  - Column 1 occupied by B (08:30-09:30) → conflicts (C: 09:00-11:00)
  - Column 2 is free → Assign C to Column 2

Result: 3 columns needed
```

---

### **Phase 4: Calculate Total Columns**

For each group, find the maximum column number used:

```typescript
const maxColumn = Math.max(...assignments);
const totalColumns = maxColumn + 1;

// All events in group get this totalColumns value
```

**Why this matters:**
- Events in the same overlap group share the same width
- Creates consistent visual appearance
- Proper space distribution

---

### **Phase 5: Final Layout Calculation**

```typescript
for each event:
  // Vertical position
  top = startHour × HOUR_HEIGHT
  height = (endHour - startHour) × HOUR_HEIGHT
  
  // Horizontal position with gaps
  availableWidth = 100% - (GAP × (totalColumns - 1))
  columnWidth = availableWidth / totalColumns
  left = column × (columnWidth + GAP) + 0.5%
  width = columnWidth - 1% (minimum 8%)
```

**Constants:**
- `HOUR_HEIGHT = 40px` - Height per hour
- `GAP_PERCENTAGE = 1.5%` - Space between columns
- `MIN_WIDTH = 8%` - Minimum event width
- `VISUAL_OFFSET = 0.5%` - Extra separation

---

## 🎨 Visual Examples

### Example 1: Simple Sequential Events
```
08:00-09:00 Event A
09:00-10:00 Event B
10:00-11:00 Event C

Groups: [A], [B], [C]

Result:
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Event A (100% width)│
├─────────────────────┤
│ Event B (100% width)│
├─────────────────────┤
│ Event C (100% width)│
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Example 2: Two Overlapping Events
```
08:00-10:00 Event A
08:30-09:30 Event B

Groups: [A, B]

Result:
┌──────────┬─────────┐
│ Event A  │ Event B │
│ (49%)    │ (49%)   │
│          ├─────────┤
│          │         │
└──────────┘         
```

### Example 3: Complex Overlaps (3 events)
```
08:00-10:00 Event A
08:30-09:30 Event B
09:00-11:00 Event C

Groups: [A, B, C]

Result:
┌────┬────┬────┐
│ A  │ B  │ C  │
│32% │32% │32% │
│    ├────┤    │
│    │    │    │
└────┘    │    │
          └────┘
```

### Example 4: Multiple Groups
```
08:00-09:00 Event A
08:30-09:30 Event B
10:00-11:00 Event C
10:30-11:30 Event D

Groups: [A, B], [C, D]

Result:
┌──────┬──────┐
│  A   │  B   │  Group 1 (2 columns)
│ 49%  │ 49%  │
├──────┴──────┤
│             │  Gap (no events)
├──────┬──────┤
│  C   │  D   │  Group 2 (2 columns, reuses columns 0-1)
│ 49%  │ 49%  │
└──────┴──────┘
```

**Key Benefit:** Groups C&D reuse the same column positions as A&B because they don't overlap!

## 🔍 Algorithm Complexity

### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting:** O(n log n)
- **Group Detection:** O(n × g) where g = number of groups
- **Column Assignment:** O(n × c) where c = max columns per group
- **Layout Calculation:** O(n)
- **Total:** O(n log n + n × max(g, c))

Typically **O(n log n)** in practice since g and c are usually small constants.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)** for event layouts
- **O(g)** for overlap groups
- **Total:** O(n)

---

## 🎯 Key Parameters & Tuning

### Constants You Can Adjust:

```typescript
const HOUR_HEIGHT = 40;           // Pixels per hour
const GAP_PERCENTAGE = 1.5;       // Gap between events (%)
const MIN_WIDTH = 8;              // Minimum event width (%)
const VISUAL_OFFSET = 0.5;        // Extra left offset (%)
```

### Width Calculation Formula:

```
availableWidth = 100% - (GAP × (totalColumns - 1))
columnWidth = availableWidth / totalColumns
finalWidth = columnWidth - 1% (but >= MIN_WIDTH)
leftPosition = column × (columnWidth + GAP) + VISUAL_OFFSET
```

**Example with 3 columns:**
```
GAP = 1.5%
availableWidth = 100 - (1.5 × 2) = 97%
columnWidth = 97 / 3 = 32.33%
finalWidth = 32.33 - 1 = 31.33%

Column 0: left = 0 + 0.5 = 0.5%,   width = 31.33%
Column 1: left = 33.83 + 0.5 = 34.33%, width = 31.33%
Column 2: left = 67.66 + 0.5 = 68.16%, width = 31.33%
```

## ✨ Special Features

### 1. **Independent Group Optimization**
- Each overlap group calculates columns independently
- Groups that don't overlap can share column positions
- Maximizes screen space utilization

### 2. **Smart Column Reuse**
```typescript
// Column becomes available when previous event ends
if (columns[col] <= event.startTime) {
  // Column is free, reuse it!
}
```

### 3. **Minimum Width Protection**
```typescript
width: Math.max(columnWidth - 1, 8)
```
Ensures events are always visible, even with many columns.

### 4. **Visual Separation**
```typescript
left: leftPosition + 0.5%
```
Small offset prevents events from appearing "glued together".

## 🆚 Comparison: Old vs New Algorithm

### Test Case: 5 Events with Complex Overlaps

**Events:**
```
A: 08:00-10:00
B: 08:30-09:30
C: 09:00-10:30
D: 10:00-11:00
E: 11:00-12:00
```

**Old Algorithm Result:**
```
Problem: Might create 3-4 columns for entire set
- Wasted space when events don't actually overlap
- E gets narrow width even though it's alone
```

**New Algorithm Result:**
```
Group 1: [A, B, C, D] → 3 columns needed
Group 2: [E] → 1 column (full width)

✓ E gets 100% width (it's in its own group)
✓ A, B, C, D efficiently packed in 3 columns
✓ No wasted space
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### 1. **Early Return for Empty Arrays**
```typescript
if (dayEvents.length === 0) return [];
```

### 2. **Single-Event Groups (Fast Path)**
```typescript
if (group.length === 1) {
  // Skip complex column assignment
  return fullWidth;
}
```

### 3. **Cached Calculations**
- `startHour` and `endHour` calculated once
- `columnAssignments` array reused
- No redundant overlap checks

## 🔧 Debugging Tips

If events overlap incorrectly:

1. **Check Group Detection**
   ```typescript
   console.log('Overlap Groups:', overlapGroups);
   ```

2. **Verify Column Assignments**
   ```typescript
   console.log('Column Assignments:', columnAssignments);
   ```

3. **Inspect Final Layouts**
   ```typescript
   console.log('Layout:', { left, width, column, totalColumns });
   ```

4. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Single event → Should be 100% width
   - Two overlapping → Should be ~49% each
   - Sequential events → All should reuse column 0
